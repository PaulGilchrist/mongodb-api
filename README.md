* [Create a web API with ASP.NET Core and MongoDB](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mongo-app?view=aspnetcore-5.0&tabs=visual-studio)

## Summary

This project is to show proper usage of the MongoDB Driver for C# in a .Net Core REST API project.  Hopefully we will also be able to show full OData functionality without the need for Entity Framework, leveraging LINQ instead.
